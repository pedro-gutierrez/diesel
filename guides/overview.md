# Overview

**Diesel** is a toolkit that allows you to design extensible DSLs in Elixir.

DSLs built with Diesel are:

* **declarative**: they look just like HTML
* **structured**: the schema is checked at compile time
* **extensible**: via package modules and generators

## Installation

The package can be installed by adding `diesel` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:diesel, "~> 0.5"}
  ]
end
```
